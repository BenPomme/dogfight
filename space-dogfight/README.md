# Space Dogfight

A browser-based 3D space combat game built with Three.js and JavaScript featuring voice-controlled assistant drones.

## Overview

Space Dogfight is a physics-based spaceship combat game featuring:
- Arcade-style flight controls with physics-based movement
- Physics-based movement with inertia and drift
- Multiple weapon systems (lasers, missiles, etc.)
- Enemy AI fighters with combat tactics
- Visual effects for weapons, explosions and impacts
- Voice-controlled assistant drone wingmen (upcoming)
- Various game modes (campaign, free-for-all, vs AI)

## Technology Stack

- **Three.js** - WebGL-based 3D rendering
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Web interface and HUD elements
- **Node.js** - Backend server (for multiplayer features)
- **WebSockets** - Real-time multiplayer communication
- **WebRTC** - Voice capture and processing
- **OpenAI Voice API** - Voice command recognition

## Game Controls

### 3D Mode Controls (Arcade Mode)
- **W** - Accelerate/Increase throttle
- **Arrow Keys** - Control pitch (up/down) and yaw (left/right)
- **Q/E** - Roll left/right
- **Space** - Fire primary weapon (laser)
- **D** - Fire secondary weapon (missiles)
- **ESC** - Pause menu

### 2D Mode Controls (Top-Down Mode)
- **Up Arrow or W** - Accelerate forward
- **Down Arrow or S** - Brake/reverse
- **A/D or Left/Right Arrow** - Turn left/right
- **Space** - Fire primary weapon (lasers)
- **Shift** - Fire secondary weapon (missiles)
- **ESC** - Pause game

### Traditional Controls (Other Game Modes)
- **W/A/S/D** - Move forward/left/backward/right
- **Mouse** - Aim ship
- **Left Click** - Fire primary weapon (laser)
- **Right Click** - Fire secondary weapon (missiles)
- **E** - Boost
- **R** - Brake
- **Q/Z** - Roll left/right
- **Mouse Wheel** - Adjust camera zoom
- **Tab** - View scoreboard
- **Esc** - Pause menu

### Voice Commands for Assistant Drones
- **"Drone, attack target"** - Command attack drone to fire on current target
- **"Activate shield"** - Command defense drone to activate shield
- **"Scan area"** - Command recon drone to scan the surrounding area
- **"All drones, attack"** - Command all available drones to attack (higher level)

## Assistant Drone System

### Categories and Levels
The game features an evolving "Wingman" drone system with 3 categories:
- **Attack Drones** - Equipped with gunners and missile systems
- **Defense Drones** - Provide shields and electronic countermeasures
- **Recon Drones** - Scanning capabilities and beacon deployment

### Voice Integration
The game implements voice command recognition:
1. Captures microphone audio via WebRTC
2. Sends audio stream to OpenAI Voice API
3. Receives transcription and intent
4. Maps intent to drone command actions

### Drone AI and Behavior
- Each drone category uses specialized behavior trees
- Drones have multiple states: idle, follow, execute, return
- Actions have priorities and cooldowns
- Visual and audio feedback for voice commands

### Progression System
- **Level 1**: Single attack drone with basic capabilities
- **Level 2**: Adds defense drone with shield capabilities
- **Level 3**: Adds recon drone and enables combo voice commands
