# Space Dogfight: Endless Replayability Design Document

## Core Design Philosophy

Space Dogfight will be transformed into an endlessly replayable experience inspired by roguelite mechanics and progression systems found in games like Vampire Survivors, Hades, and Risk of Rain. The core gameplay loop will focus on:

1. **Session-based combat** - Each play session is a complete experience with a defined beginning and end
2. **Procedural challenges** - Dynamically generated enemy waves, environmental hazards, and encounters
3. **Meta-progression** - Persistent upgrades that carry over between sessions
4. **Build variety** - Multiple viable build paths through weapons, abilities, and ship configurations
5. **Emergent gameplay** - Synergistic combinations of weapons and abilities that create unique experiences

## Gameplay Systems

### 1. Combat Session Structure

Each gameplay session will follow this structure:

- **Starting loadout**: Player begins with a basic ship and one primary weapon
- **Wave-based progression**: Increasingly difficult waves of enemies attack the player
- **Time pressure**: Overall session timer (e.g., 20-30 minutes) before a "final boss" wave
- **Area transitions**: Option to move to new arenas with different environmental hazards after clearing specific waves
- **Risk/reward decisions**: Choose between immediate power-ups or potential better rewards later

### 2. Enemy Variety System

Enemies will be categorized into distinct types with unique behaviors and attributes:

#### Enemy Types
- **Interceptors**: Fast, agile ships that focus on hit-and-run tactics
- **Destroyers**: Heavily armored ships with powerful weapons but slow turning
- **Support Carriers**: Ships that deploy drones and provide buffs to nearby enemies
- **Stealth Fighters**: Ships that can cloak and ambush the player
- **Swarmers**: Weak ships that attack in coordinated groups
- **Elite Variants**: Enhanced versions of regular enemies with special abilities
- **Mini-Bosses**: Appear at intervals to provide greater challenge and rewards

#### Enemy Behaviors
- **Hunting**: Actively pursues player with predictive movement
- **Flanking**: Attempts to circle around and attack from blind spots
- **Kiting**: Maintains distance while firing ranged weapons
- **Swarming**: Coordinates with other enemies to surround player
- **Retreating**: Pulls back when damaged to regroup
- **Ambushing**: Lies in wait and attacks when player is vulnerable
- **Defending**: Protects high-value targets or specific areas

### 3. Weapon System & Combat Tree

The weapon system will be the primary progression path during gameplay, featuring branching upgrades and combinations:

#### Weapon Categories
- **Ballistic**: Projectile-based weapons (machine guns, cannons)
- **Energy**: Beam and burst weapons (lasers, plasma)
- **Explosive**: Area damage weapons (missiles, bombs)
- **Special**: Unique effect weapons (tractor beams, EMP)

#### Weapon Properties
- **Base stats**: Damage, fire rate, range, accuracy
- **Projectile behavior**: Homing, piercing, bouncing, splitting
- **Area effects**: Explosion radius, burn area, shockwave
- **Status effects**: Burn, slow, weaken, vulnerability

#### Upgrade Tree Example (Laser Path)
```
Basic Laser
├── Twin Laser (fires two beams)
│   ├── Quad Laser (fires four beams)
│   │   └── Death Star (massive beam with charge-up)
│   └── Spread Laser (wider angle)
│       └── Laser Wall (180° spread)
└── Focused Laser (higher damage, longer range)
    ├── Piercing Laser (passes through enemies)
    │   └── Railgun (instant hit, line damage)
    └── Heat Laser (adds burning effect)
        └── Fusion Beam (burning enemies explode)
```

#### Weapon Synergies
Weapons will have synergistic effects when used together or when paired with specific ship systems:

- **Cryo Cannon + Shatter Missiles**: Frozen enemies take 3x damage from impacts
- **Ion Beams + EMP Torpedoes**: Disabled enemies take continuous damage
- **Gravity Well + Mining Laser**: Pulled enemies take increasing damage over time
- **Flak Cannon + Proximity Mines**: Creates chain reaction explosions

### 4. Power-up and Boost System

Power-ups will spawn from destroyed enemies and as time-based events:

#### Temporary Boosts
- **Shield Overcharge**: Temporary invulnerability (5 seconds)
- **Weapon Overload**: Increased fire rate and damage (10 seconds)
- **Engine Surge**: Increased speed and maneuverability (15 seconds)
- **Time Warp**: Slows down enemies but not player (7 seconds)
- **Quantum Clone**: Creates temporary copies of player ship (12 seconds)

#### Persistent Session Upgrades
- **Weapon Modifications**: Change weapon behavior (bouncing shots, piercing, etc.)
- **Ship Systems**: Add capabilities (shield regeneration, auto-turrets, etc.)
- **Passive Abilities**: Ongoing effects (damage reflection, enemy slowdown on hit, etc.)

#### Upgrade Choices
After clearing major waves or at timed intervals, players choose between 3-4 upgrade options:
- New weapons
- Weapon upgrades
- Ship system improvements
- Passive abilities

### 5. Ship Customization and Meta-Progression

Between play sessions, players will unlock permanent upgrades and customization options:

#### Ship Types
- **Interceptor**: High speed, low armor, focused on evasion
- **Assault**: Balanced speed and armor with weapon specialization
- **Destroyer**: Heavy armor, slow turning, high damage output
- **Support**: Shield-focused with drone deployment capabilities
- **Stealth**: Cloaking ability with ambush bonuses

#### Permanent Progression Systems
- **Tech Tree**: Unlock new baseline weapons and systems
- **Ship Blueprints**: Unlock new ship types and variants
- **Pilot Skills**: Permanent stat boosts and special abilities
- **Starting Loadouts**: Define different beginning configurations

#### Currency Systems
- **Credits**: Basic currency from destroying enemies
- **Tech Fragments**: Rare currency from elite enemies for technology unlocks
- **Void Crystals**: Boss-drop currency for special unlocks

### 6. Environmental Variation

Different play areas will provide unique challenges and strategic opportunities:

#### Arena Types
- **Asteroid Field**: Dense obstacles providing cover and collision hazards
- **Nebula Cloud**: Reduced visibility with pockets of damaging radiation
- **Debris Field**: Destructible objects that can damage enemies when destroyed
- **Gravity Wells**: Areas that pull or push ships, affecting movement
